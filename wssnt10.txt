That's where the regular expressions come in. You'll notice that the expression is bracketed by two "(.*)" statements. In regular expression language, the "." command matches any string and the "*" repeats whatever command precedes it zero or more times, so together they will match any string of any length. When bracketed around a search term, like "love," it should return a match on a line of text regardless of where in the line "love" appears. In other words, it would match "She loves you," "love is a many spendored thing" or "ain't talking 'bout love."
